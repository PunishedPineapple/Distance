Distance:
	-Game appears to use meters and yalms interchangably, depending on client language.  Both units appear to be treated as equal in length for this game.
	-Boss radius needs to take into account BNpc scale, but Dalamud handles this for us.
	-Player hitring is 0.5y radius.  This varies when mounted, but the specific visual radius when mounted does not seem to actually be used for any distance-based calculations.


Player to Enemy Ranges:
	-The ranges stated by the game for targeted skills are from the edge of the player's hitring to the edge of the enemy's hitring.  This applies to auto attacks too.
	-AoE skills centered on the player unsurprisingly use distance from player center for their stated effect range.
	-Some enemies (only seen so far on striking dummies, but not thoroughly tested) do not get hit by AoE attacks that significantly intersect their hitbox.  The reason for this is unknown.


Player to Player Ranges (PvE):
	-Single Target works like single target damage: Skill range plus your character's hitring radius to character ring.
		-This applies to all beneficial skills tested (Healing, Rescue, Cover, TBN, etc.)
	-AoE healing radius is to ally's center, just like enemy AoEs hitting players.


Player to Player Ranges (PvP):
	-Untested


Enemy to Player Ranges:
	-AoE effects centered on boss use range from boss center to player center.
	-Targeted effects from boss are unclear.  Limited testing did not match ranges in the Action sheet in any meaningful way, but I only checked a couple of bosses.


Player to Trust:
	-Targeted effects use player ring to Trust NPC ring.
	-AoE effects centered on player use Trust NPC center for distance (center to center).


Player to NPC:
	-Interaction distance is 6y from player ring, did not change when mounted on larger mount.


Player to Gathering Node:
	-Interaction distance is 3y from player center to node ring.
	-Dismount distance seems to be 3.5y regardless of player ring size when mounted.


Player to EventObjects:
	-Variable, not well tested.


Misc:
	-Striking dummies are really weird; targeted skills work at stated range, aoe skills and autos act like their hitring is 0.5y.
		-This only appears to apply to some dummies (Level 50 one at house was like this (BNpc ID 541), level 80 ones at Ondo Cups worked like normal enemies).
		-This actually appears to potentially be due to these striking dummies having the object be raised up off of the ground, so your ground distance is within hit
			hit range, but AoE skills might use actual distance, not the projected distance?  That makes things a mess if so.
			-After some testing, it is not the 3D distance difference either; it appears to be based on ring distance without a height influence.
			-Furthermore, after repositioning the dummy on the lawn made it no longer have the object raised, even going back to the same spot.  Idk what was going on.
				-Placing it back up against the slanted pillar and then going into an instance and leaving again has the object raised again with the model sitting
					on the ground.  Collision hitbox of the dummy might be doing strange things on the fence slant.
			-Overall, back to square one of their hitrings just being 0.5y for AoE/autos, but 1.5y for single target (and visually).


Autos:
	-Melee autos appear to be 3.1y, not 3y?  Ranged are also 25.1y, not 25y.  They are exactly 3y and 25y vertically, though.
	-Ranged autos do not appear to be affected by line of sight obstructions, at least in the vertical direction (testing from roof of house).
	-As with all other skills, autos ignore target radius for height (there is no "ring" in the Y axis).


Height:
	-AoE attacks (those with a radius, but no range) appear to take effect only within 5y vertically (both above and below).  This applies regardless of shape (circle, cone, line).
		-AoE attacks that originate from you, but require a target, will hit that target when within the range vertically, but no other enemies will be hit outside of +-5y.
			-This applies regardless of shape, but is only currently relevant for cones and lines, such as DRG line skills, MCH targeted cone skills, and SAM targeted cone skills.
		-AoE attacks that target an enemy and produce a radius around it (i.e., Flare) will hit when within the cast range vertically, but adjacent enemies must be within +-5y of the target to also be hit.
		-It is very difficult to test targeted actions that also have a radius, but they *appear* to hit within their range vertically, at least for the enemy targeted.
	-Ranged autos/skills used the 2D distance to ring until above the skill range's height.
		-Throwing Dagger and Raiton went out of range greater than 20y above the target (total distance was 25.6y)
			-Error message was "Target is not in range", but the skill on the hotbar did not have a red X until horizontal distance was beyond skill range (+0.5y).
		-DNC and WHM skills worked the same for their respective ranges.
		-WAR melee skills worked the same for their respective ranges.
		-Melee autos worked at exactly 3y above the target.
	-AoE healing effects (at least from fairy) are also restricted to +-5y.
	-Fairy height difference for casting was inconsistent.  Unsure if pet logic issue or distance issue.


Aggro:
	-Aggro range appears to be based on distance from player center to enemy hitring (they're nice, round numbers using this distance).
	-Range to aggro seems to be variably 0.03 - 0.1 yalms less than expected.  It varies by boss, but is consistent for that boss.  Idk if this is distance/position imprecision, y-axis shenanigans, or something else.
	-Enemies might be able to have multiple types of aggro; e8s Shiva, you can get behind the boss, where presumably a true sight aggro cone was not extended a full 360 degrees, and get much closer to her than normal; however, you will pull her if you get close enough even in this "blind spot".
	-It is unknown whether sight-based aggro necessarily has a symmetric sight cone.


Focus Target:
	-Uses alpha on res node to dim when target is beyond targetable range.


Target Cursor Addon:
	-Soft Target Ring Res node is idx 12, doesn't become invisible, but alpha goes to zero when not shown.  Image nodes for it stay full alpha.
	-Focus Target Pip Res node is idx 15.  Res node alpha never changes, but image node alpha (16 and 17) go to zero when not shown.
	-Target Pip Res node is idx 18.  Uses visible flags on image modes.
	-Auto attack indicator is Res node 22.  Uses visible flag on res node.
