Bugs:
	-Aggro range showed up for a brief moment after killing boss in Levi Ex.  Check for monster dead too when deciding whether to show?
		-Check for player dead too.
		-Maybe make the trigger be boss hp <100%, or ideally just boss unaggro'd and not dead if we can find that.
		-This is more complicated than it looks for wipes, and probably requires director info to get it really right.
		-As-is, this can probably only happen with ReAction automatically restoring your focus target, so it's a pretty low priority bug.
		-Check the addon draw flags.  There is probably one for this curtain; there is for stuff like the start menu hiding certain addons.
	-Make sure that nameplate nodes use thin text when nameplates use thin text.
	-Try to fix nameplate node initial positions so that they do not jump on first use.


Arbitrary Arcs:
	-Target Aggressive status options.
	-Improve arcs to have radial lines for cones at the appropriate point, and maybe add an option to have those lines and the circle outside of the arc be dotted when not near enough angle to them for the configured arc length to show normally.
	-Make sure that arc calcs/drawing have divide by zero protection and handle negative numbers smaller than target radius gracefully.


Priority:
	-New nameplate difference feels like it might mostly just actually be the "Glare" flag on the text node.  Do more testing.  It might be the other new flag(s) too, but only when fading in from distance?
	-Add fading for aggro text/arc, but realistically, wait until aggro arcs overhaul.
	-Make the aggro distance arc have a deg/yalm option like for custom arcs.
	-Go over distance-based coloring options for non-arc things and make sure that they are sane.
		-Add options to track UI element color and transparency (two options) for each stage of distance-based color.
		-Add an option to track only UI element transparancy? (fading is always handled separately)
	-Try to find out how to project the arc coordinates onto the ground, even without in-world drawing.  This will make them a bit less awkward when there is any height variation or jumping.
	-Add text commands for arcs.
	-Improve aggressive/unaggressive detection.
	-Figure out why aoe tooltip distances are inaccurate on some enemies (i.e., certain striking dummies).
		-See RE notes for investigation so far.
	-Fix how we decide to set whether to use depth.  Surely there's a way to just get it from the nameplate's text node.
	-Show distances on party list?
		-If we do this, maybe just color code name instead of having a readout (at least as an option).
			-For color coding, allow using different distance thresholds when party member is untargeted vs. mouseover/soft/regular targeted.
	-Add distances to enemy list?
	-Improve the data file format and updater:
		-Make the datafile a CSV or similar so that additional columns can be added easily (i.e., aggro type, sight cone information, etc.)
			-Does .net CSV parser work on Linux/Mac?
				-No longer an issue; just use custom CSV parser from other project.
			-JSON, etc. out because duplicating the schema for every row is stupid.
		-Make it two files: a data file, and a version file that contains only the version number and a hash of the data file for verification.
			-Allows for only a very small file that's downloaded every time to check version, even if data size balloons.
			-Beware any newline shenanigans.
	-Investigate whether the 0.5x font scaling in nameplates is due to the high-res UI option, and account for that if necessary.


Cleanup:
	-Config option strings need to be gone over and made consistent.
	-Make nameplate sig(s) optional.
		-Implemented; just needs testing.
	-Skip some node draw setup (like color, position, whatever calculations) if just hiding the node.  Probably doesn't matter that much, but this plugin's gotten a bit heavy.
	-Finish changing BNpcID to BNpcNameID to be more accurate.
	-When we have better aggressive flags, make enemy list a separate option?


Misc:
	-Translations.


Maybe:
	-Add custom position/coordinate readout widgets.
	-Radius option for arc pip.
	-Thickness options for pip and arc?
	-Raycast and have result as a coloring option for self-centered arcs (i.e., turn an arc red if it would put you off the edge).
	-Add an option to export and import widget/arc configs, but the config options might not be the most stable things ever, so how much of a mess could this end up being?
	-Use job icons instead of abbreviations in the classjob filters config?
	-Revisit making distance-based colors optionally gradients.
	-Add icon/text nodes to nameplates to show aggro type(s) and ranges (when available).
	-Add icon nodes for the range type and boss aggro prefix?  Text versions look a bit ugly/busy, and partially don't work with some fonts.
		-Could also have other neat icons like the auto attack one (ui/uld/TargetCursor_hr1.tex) that people could attach.
	-Provide IPC for others to get aggro data?
		-Also maybe to get the aggro point on line from an enemy.
	-Option to lock aggro widget to the screen-space projection of the aggro point?
	-A text input box to let people format their aggro widget.
		-We need to be really careful to validate the string and allow no format placeholders besides "{0}".
	-Add distance-based coloring to nameplate distances, party distances, etc.?
	-Should make a more encapsulated node (or node controller or something) class before doing the preceeding; it's just getting too much tracking floating nodes with disparate functionality to have even more to do with them.
	-Add friends/fc member conditions for nameplates?
	-Add option to recolor target/focus target/soft target cursors based on distance.
	-Could maybe experiment with using depth-enabled UI nodes to draw arc beneath character?
	-Have nodes attached to cursor use nameplate font colors instead of the target bar color (with backup estimating from object type and flags when too far or too many objects on screen to be assigned a nameplate.)
		-Actually, we now have enough information from object flags to just determine it ourselves, so maybe skip looking at the nameplates.  The only thing that might be awkward is claim color for the one tag type.
	-Consider auto-resizing fixed nodes for things like the target bars so that alignment makes more sense to users.


Rejected:
	-Editor for aggro data?
		-Not worth the effort; just use a spreadsheet.
		-Having to deal with potential re-sorts based on edits would be annoying.
	-Add an ImGui window over the text node and track its position to allow for dragging?
		-Not worth the effort for a very minor convenience that will rarely be used.
	-Maybe add option to use caution/warning aggro colors as a gradient rather than just step color changes.
		-Probably more work than it's worth, and starting to get into real feature bloat.
	-ImGui cursor position seems to lag the game's cursor position, making a mouseover widget get wiggly sometimes.
		-This actually seems to happen with the game's cursor itself and game UI windows.
		-Problem fixed if using software cursor in options, so not our problem really.
